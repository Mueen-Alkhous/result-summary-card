## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me discover and learn new things like:

- Using @font-face in CSS.
- What is Variable fonts and how it works.
- Working with local fonts

also this project made me use responsive consepts for the first time and reinforce what i've learn about responsive consepts, and ofcourse improved my HTML and CSS skills.
It was really a challeng for me to make this component, but it is only a single step in my journey to become a Fron-end Dev.

### Continued development

I think I need to improve my skills on responsive desgin, structuring my HTML better, and my overall CSS skills.
